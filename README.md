# Dungeon Game
## Purpose
This was a project assignment for a programming class in Spring 2018. The goal was to create a fully functional text-based adventure game in C++ that had multiple enemy types, weapon types, combat options, items, and a final boss/end goal.

This game is basically a text-based dungeon crawler game that simulates a 4x4 grid of dungeon rooms, with varying enemy types and items in each. The player starts in the bottom left room and must make it to the top right room with at least 4/6 dungeon enemies defeated prior to facing the final boss of the dungeon.
## How to Run
Simply compile **Enemy.hpp, Enemy.cpp, Game.hpp, Game.cpp, Item.hpp, Item.cpp, Living.hpp, Living.cpp, Main.cpp, Room.hpp, and Room.cpp** using a standard C++ compiler like G++, and run the output .exe file :)
